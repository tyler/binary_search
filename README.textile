h1. Binary Search for Ruby's Arrays

One incredibly handy algorithm that is missing from Ruby's Array class is the binary search.  If we *know* for *absolute certain* that the array we're working with is sorted you can use a binary search to search through the array much much more quickly than a linear search, which would be performed with index or detect/find.

Need proof?  Howsabout some benchmarks:

So, your array must be fairly large (between 100 and 1000 elements) for the Ruby version of binary_index to be faster than Ruby's builtin index method.  However, even for arrays as small as 5 elements, the native version of the binary_index method is faster than Ruby's index.  However, for very large sized Arrays, both the the pure and the native version are much much much faster than the builtin method.

<pre>
  <code>
    require 'binary_search/native'

    x = [5,1,6,7,2,6,4,2,6,1,6,1,1,8,3,5,2].sort
    puts x.binary_index(5)
  </code>
</pre>

So the actual method is 'binary_index' as it does the same thing that 'index' does: returns the index of a matching element.  It should be noted that 'index' returns the *first* instance of a matching element.  'binary_index' is not guaranteed to return the first.  It should also be noted, again, that this will only work if the array is sorted correctly.  If it's not weird crap will happen.

Oh yeah, and don't bother trying to require 'binary_search', it'll just throw an error telling you to either require 'binary_search/pure' or 'binary_search/native'.  I'd always use native... but some people are weird.
